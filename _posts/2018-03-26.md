# Dynamic epistemic logic in modal homotopy type theory (MHoTT)

1. Dynamic epistemic logic is used to formulate multi-agent models
2. Dynamic epistemic logic is used to formulate Peirce's abductive logic [@Ma:2018:Let] 
3. MHoTT is used to formalize Hegel's logic
4. Hegel's Science of Logic has been formalized in MHoTT
5. MHoTT has been used to formalize 

Conclusion:  Developing dynamic epistemic logic within MHoTT could be used to help formalize a Hegelian/Peircean social philosophy.
