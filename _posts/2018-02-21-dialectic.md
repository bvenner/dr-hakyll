So what is the relationship between Peirce's semeiotic and Hegel's dialectic?  More formally, can the modal homotopy type theory applied to Hegel's dialectical logic also be used to understand Peirce's semeiotic?  It might be useful to explore this question more informally.

Peirce's development of his tripartite division of logic into speculative grammar, logical critic and speculative rhetoric parallels the Scholastic triviuum of grammar, dialectic and rhetoric.  Pushing this analogy, we could identify Peirce's logical critic with Scholastic dialectic.
