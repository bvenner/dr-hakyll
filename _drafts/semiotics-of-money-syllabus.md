# Money in flux
## Rise of digital currencies

# What is money?

# Digital money
<!---
I'd like to use one of the open-source digital
platforms for the design of money.  Perhaps Ethereum.

Another possibility would be the categorical 
informatics platform AQL.  This has the advantage
of clear syntax, a graphical design, categorical 
semantics

# Semiotics:  the doctrine of signs

## Semiotics and category theory
Since this is an intro class, there is not a
strong dependence on math and category theory.  Think about
developing an intermediate course that does more 
proofs and is more math dependent.  Maybe a three course
sequence, with categorical semiotics and this course as 
pre-requisites.
