In dealing with questions of fact lawyers are necessarily concerned with judgements about probabilities - Philip Dawid

#Standards of evidence
- Civil: preponderance of probabilities
- Criminal:  beyond a reasonable doubt

# The role of probability in the legal system

1.  The actual values of probabilities appear directly in testimony

2.  A general framework for describing, structuring, quantifying and manipulating the relationship  between evidence and hypothesis.

The theory of "classical" probability is "a" logic of inference under uncertainty

# Some pitfalls of statistical Evidence

## Example 1

Data:  Facility A had 15 violations over the last 10 years.  Facility B has never had a regulatory violation.

Inference:  Facility A is a better inspection target.

Fallacy:  neglect the denominator

## Example 2

Data:  Out of every hundred children that leave school early, as many as 15 will at some time in their lives be convicted of a criminal offense

Inference:  Leaving school early is associated with increased criminal activity

Fallacy:  incomplete data

Conclusion:  meaningful inference from statistical data must involve a comparison of two or more quantities

Be aware of possible confounding.

## Example 3

Data:  80% of all alcoholics were bottle-fed as babies.

Inference:  A bottle-fed baby has a high chance of becoming an alcoholics

## Example 4

Data:  Work up TCLP/XRF data?  Compare sensitivity/specificity numbers.  Should I screen?
