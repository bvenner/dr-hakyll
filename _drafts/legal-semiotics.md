Ellerman shows that the foundational assumption of capitalism is that "ownership of the firm" is an invalid notion becasue it rests upon the idea that persons can be owned.  He proposes *economic democracy* as an alternative and bases this idea on Locke's labor theory of property.

Ellerman also points out that the negative application of the labor theory of property is that since persons do not create the *land*, then land cannot be property.  In particular, future generations have an inalienable right to the land.  This notion seems close to the public trust doctrine.

So what does the labor theory of property imply about *capital*, the third factor of production?  Are *capital* and *property* the same concept?  
that all the fruits of one's labor belong to labor
