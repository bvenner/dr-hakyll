+ The semiology of *Arrival*.  What a Peircean semiotic treatment might look like.

+ Veiwing Peirce's 10 classes of signs as a three-category structure.

+ Comparing Ellerman's notion of adjoint triple to the topos-theoretic model of [adjoint modality](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+modality) used by Schreiber, Lawvere, etc..

+ Related to the previous idea, develop *strong* categorical semiotics using Ellerman's notion of adjuctions describing concrete universals.

+ Develop category theoretic model of Peirce's gamma graphs.

+ Running markdown files through the [Knowledge Graph API](https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph)
