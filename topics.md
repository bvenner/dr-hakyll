+ The semiology of *Arrival*.  What a Peircean semiotic treatment might look like.

+ Analogy between Peirce's 6 aspects of signs as a three-category structure.
Peirce | three-category
Sign | category
Objects | Two-category (or monodial two-category)
Immediate object | Horizontal composition
Dynamic object | Vertical composition
Interpretant | Three-category
Immediate interpetant |
Actual interpretant |
Final interpretant |


+ Comparing Ellerman's notion of adjoint triple to the topos-theoretic model of [adjoint modality](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+modality) used by Schreiber, Lawvere, etc..

+ Related to the previous idea, develop *strong* categorical semiotics using Ellerman's notion of adjuctions describing concrete universals.

+ Develop category theoretic model of Peirce's gamma graphs.
