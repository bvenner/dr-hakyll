title:  Ideas for future posts

+ The semiology of *Arrival*.  What a Peircean semiotic treatment might look like.

+ Veiwing Peirce's 10 classes of signs as a three-category structure.

+ Comparing Ellerman's notion of half-adjoints to the topos-theoretic model of [adjoint modality](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+modality) used by Schreiber, Lawvere, etc..

+ Related to the previous idea, develop *strong* categorical semiotics using Ellerman's notion of adjuctions describing concrete universals.

+ Develop category theoretic model of Peirce's gamma graphs.  

+ Is there a relationship between [adjoint logic](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+logic) and the tinctured existential graphs?

+ Running markdown files through the [Knowledge Graph API](https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph)

+ Dusko Pavlovic had a nice paper called *The Continuum as Final Coalgebra*.  Work out the modal logic of the continuum as an example.

+ Peirce's diagram of the three-category structure looks a little bit like the coalgebra structures in the previous paper.  Is there something there?

+ In Schreiber's discussion of [adjoint modality](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+modality), the middle functor is *full and faithful.*  In Ellerman's notion of half-adjunction, the basic identities are given as functions between hom-sets.  How are these hom-sets related to the notion of *full and faithful.*  Work out as an example.

+ Nathan Houser's review of [Perice and the Threat of Nominalism](http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/peirce-and-the-threat-of-nominalism/) states 
  >According to Peirce, each of the traditional nominalist theories, correspondence, coherence, consensus, and instrumental reliability, "rightly identify essential elements of truth"
  This list reminds me of the [Daubert Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daubert_standard) *illustrative factors*.  Can this list be expanded, and is there a realist theory of science that the Daubert rulings are striving for?
